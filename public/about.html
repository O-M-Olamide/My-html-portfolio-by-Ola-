<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Oseni Mustapha Olamide, an 18-year-old Computer Science student from Nigeria. Currently, I'm in my third year at university, where Iâ€™m pursuing a first-class degree. I'm passionate about technology, particularly in areas like software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. With a strong commitment to using tech for global change, I aspire to create impactful solutions that address real-world problems.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I've had the opportunity to serve in various leadership roles, including volunteering with Slum2School Africa, an NGO that supported my education. This experience not only built my public speaking and leadership skills but also inspired me to give back to my community.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing football, public speaking, and continuously learning new things. I look forward to making a meaningful difference in the tech industry and beyond.</p>
